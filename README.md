# AMBA-AXI4-Stream-AXIS-Protocol
AXI4-Stream (AXIS) is a unidirectional streaming protocol from ARM's AMBA family for moving data between IP blocks in FPGAs/SoCs. It uses a TVALID/TREADY handshake with optional TLAST, TKEEP, and TUSER for packet boundaries, byte qualifiers, and metadata, ideal for video, DMA, and accelerators.
